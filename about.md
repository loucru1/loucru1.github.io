**Name:** Louis Cruz  
**Location:** Los Angeles, CA | Ithaca, NY  
**Occupation:** Senior at Cornell University  
**Email:** lac323@cornell.edu

I am senior studying computer science at Cornell University. My interests
include bitcoin, philosophy, math, and economics. This blog is my haphazard
attempt of keeping the world updated with what I am spending my time on. 

This past summer I worked at Google developing a tool to track and visualize
database mutations over time. In the past I have also worked at Comcast doing
data science to analyze customer sentiment, and NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory where developed a mission planning tool for the
[Dawn](http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/) mission. I also participated in Cornell's
[Violet Satellite Project](https://cusat.cornell.edu/violet/), helping to
develop low level packet management software.
