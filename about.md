I am junior studying computer science at Cornell University. This summer I am
working as a data science intern at Comcast, using Natural Language Processing
methods to analyze customer sentiment to identify areas of improvement on the email platform. I am new to machine learning and data science, and I am using this blog as a method to archive my process.

In the past I have worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory  developing a mission planning tool for the [Dawn](http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/) mission. I also participated in Cornell's [Violet Satellite Project](https://cusat.cornell.edu/violet/), helping to develop low level packet management software.
