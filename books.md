# On the Radar

* __Jorge Luis Borges__, [_Labryinths_](https://www.amazon.com/Labyrinths-Directions-Paperbook-Jorge-Borges/dp/0811216993/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1519579062&sr=1-1&keywords=labyrinth+jorge)

# Recently Finished

* __Abram Tertz__, [_The Trial Begins_](https://www.amazon.com/Trial-Begins-Socialist-Realism/dp/0520046773/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1519578434&sr=1-1&keywords=the+trial+begins)
Highly recommended, an engaging and short read. In this short novel, Tertz satires Marxist Russia through the lives of a family.
Each character is equally fascinating and insightful. Tertz's highly vivid metaphorical imagery makes the read that much more enjoyable.

* __Thomas Sowell__, [_The Vision of the Anointed_](https://www.amazon.com/Vision-Anointed-Self-Congratulation-Social-Policy/dp/046508995X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1520359941&sr=8-1)
Excellent book, highly recommended. I found this book particularly useful in understanding the current state of Left politics. Sowell deconstructs the false assumptions and failures of the "Anointed" -- political intellectuals who's 'superior' intellect and morals guide their attempts to 'fix' society and government. Moreover, Sowell presents a paradigm of thinking which views the world as system under constraints. For example, added resources to one part of the system will invariably lead to decreased resources to another.

* __Tadeusz Borowski__, [_This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen_](https://www.amazon.com/This-Ladies-Gentlemen-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140186247/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1519577888&sr=1-1&keywords=this+way+for+the+gas+ladies+and+gentlemen)
Great book, recommended. Borowski offers a truly unique prospective on the Holocaust as a Kappo, a prisoner forced to aid the genocide in concentration camps. Borowski's stories are a lens into a brutal life where shunning morality is a necessity for survival. He captures the darkest of human nature and man's ability to endure the worst of conditions.

* __Kurt Vonnuget__, [_The Sirens of Titan_](https://www.amazon.com/Sirens-Titan-S-F-Masterworks/dp/1857988841/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
Recommended. Classic Vonnuget, full of satire and wit, combined with a bit of science fiction. In Sirens of Titan, Vonneget highlights the absurdity of religion, the lack of free will, and the ultimate purpose of life. A short and enjoyable read.

* __Josh Waitzkin__, [_The Art of Learning_](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1519577809&sr=8-1)
Fairly good. It is always interesting going through the mind of people at the top of their field, this book is no exception. In this book, Waitzkin synthesizes the art of learning through years of being a top competitor in Chess and Tai Chi. I found his observations useful, though they were mostly reinforcing ideas which I was exposed through from a [course offered on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).

* __W. Timothy Gallwey__, [_The Inner Game of Tennis_](https://www.amazon.com/Inner-Game-Tennis-Classic-Performance/dp/0679778314/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) Okay, read if you have extra time. A book on focus and tennis. Though I don't play tennis, I found this book to be widely applicable to learning how cultivate focus in general. How Gallwey describes focus reminds me of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's [flow states](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow).

* __Plato__, [_Various Writings_](https://www.amazon.com/Plato-Complete-Works/dp/0872203492/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1519579572&sr=1-1&keywords=plato+complete+works)
These reading was done for a class on Plato I was taking Fall 2017. I was very excited going in but ended up reading mostly about Plato's metaphysics, which I was not particularly interested in. I did, however, enjoy _The Republic_ and _Philebus_. I am done reading Plato for now but I hope to go back with a new lens of focus in the future.

* __Aristotle__, [_Nichomachean Ethics_](https://www.amazon.com/Nicomachean-Ethics-Aristotle/dp/0872204642)
I read this Spring 2017 as part of a class on ancient politics. When I began to read this, I did not find Aristotle convincing. I believe this was mostly due to it being my first proper introduction to ancient philosophy. However, towards the end of reading I was very fond of Aristotle's philosophy. In my mind, I linked Aristotle's view of 'being at work' as type of being present, or flow state. This little observation really opened my perspective to Aristotle's teachings on other topics.

* __Frank Herbert__, [_Dune_](https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Chronicles-Book-1/dp/0441013597/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1519580380&sr=1-1)
I read the start multiple times. I get distracted easily. I will get back to it one day. Or maybe just listen to it on Audible.
