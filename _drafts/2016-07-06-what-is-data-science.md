Answering the question of what is machine learning and data science?

- Intro
    - Question? What is Data science
        - Field of understanding and extracting knowledge from data
            - Exploratory analysis, machine learning, statistical learning
    - Question: What is Machine learning
        - Method of data analysis
        - Used primarily for prediction
            - Predict if an email is spam
            - Predict the category for a news article
        - Contrast: Statistical learning
            - Answers inference problems from data
- Body
    - How:
        - What are the inputs  - Data
            - geolocation
            - timestamps
            - images
            - strings
        - What are the outputs
            - Models
                - input new data -> prediction
        - What is the process
            - Feature creation
            - Training a model
    - Types
        - Supervised
            - data is labeled
        - Unsupervised
            - data is not labeled
- Conclusion
    - Useful in broad range of applications
    - Will be more prevalent as amount of data generated increases
